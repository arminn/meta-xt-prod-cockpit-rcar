Description=Android VM
# NOTE 1
# Pay attention that corresponding part for
# Dom0's backend-ready@block.service is
# DomD's block-up-notification.service.
# NOTE 2
# If your product needs additional dependency, consider to use
# systemd drop-in units instead of modifications in this file.
# NOTE 3
# Dependencies (After=, Requires=) cannot be reset to an empty list,
# so dependencies can only be added in drop-ins. If you want to
# remove dependencies, you have to override the entire unit.
